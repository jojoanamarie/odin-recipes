        <p>Cherry tomato flowers, Italian parsley petals, bell pepper butterflies, chive bouquet stems,<br>
        green bean grass. No, this isn’t some kind of weird Willy Wonka botanical wonderland.<br>
        These are just a few of the eye-appealing elements <em>Instagrammer</em> Diane Morrisey<br>
        uses to fashion lovely landscapes on focaccia!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plus 1 Tbsp. 00 flour</li>
            <li>1 cup plus 1 Tbsp. and 2 tsp. all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp. fine sea salt</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine flours and salt. In a small mixing bowl,<br>
                stir together a little less than 1 cup lukewarm tap water, yeast and olive oil;<br>
                pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until combined,<br>
                approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.<br>
                Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball.<br>
                Place on floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest and rise for<br>
                3 to 4 hours at room temperature.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Coat a pan with olive oil and spread dough evenly.<br>
                Dock (or poke) the dough well with your fingertips. Decorate however you want, making sure<br>
                that you press the ingredients into the dough to slightly adhere them. Drizzle with<br>
                olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake at 400°F for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Let it cool on a wire rack; then ooh, aah and devour.
