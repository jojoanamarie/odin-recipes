        <p>We love using social media as inspiration for recipes.<br>
            So when we see a trend as delicious and healthy as the baked oats<br>
            you can find all over TikTok right now, we knew we had to make our own version.<br>
            The true genius behind this method is the blending of the oats to create<br>
            a powder that resembles flour. This allows the baked result to feel more cake<br>
            than breakfast, while still providing all the benefits of having a bowl of oats in the morning.<br>
        </p>

        <p>You could truly go wild with whatever toppings you want, but we went with<br>
            two breakfast staples: <strong>Nutella and banana</strong>.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>1/2 c. rolled old-fashioned oats</li>
            <li>2 bananas, divided</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 c. milk of choice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. maple syrup</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. Nutella</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350ยบ . Grease a small baking dish.<br>
                In a blender, grind oats until it is a fine powder and set aside.<br>
                In a medium bowl, mash 1 banana until smooth. Whisk in egg, milk<br>
                and maple syrup. Fold in ground oats and baking powder until<br>
                it resembles a pourable batter.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour batter and drop dollops of Nutella in different spots<br>
                throughout the batter. Using a butter knife, swirl Nutella through batter.<br>
                Slice remaining banana and place on top of batter.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted<br>
                in middle comes out clean, about 25 minutes. 
            </li>
        </ol>
