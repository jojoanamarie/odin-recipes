        <p>Don't pass up on this seemingly too easy and simple tiktok recipe.<br>
        Because when you think about it, egges cooked in pesto makes so much sense.<br>
        All the herb-y goodness in that pesto sauce--that basil, parmesan, and even pine nuts<br>
        fry up into this cripsy and nutty flavor which integrates with the creamy egg--IT'S JUST TOO GOOD!<br>
